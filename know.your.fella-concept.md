..
few more, maybe someone from the new generations?
john resig, jef atwood, joel spolsky, Kathy Sierra
..

30 seconds for each question. possibility for automatic roll-out?
trigger of new question without displaying results.

...
at the end of trivia, ask the audience for result display now or at the end of the presentation?

if now, slide down and explain the delayed gratification experiment. after that show the results on one page. (or go back from the start and display same slide but this time with answers?)
or display charts calculated from each question results??? (requires more hacking)

if later, show few more slides explaining the importance of knowing the industry leaders/movers and keep following the trends. getting out of the box and expanding your horizons.
afer that, display the results and again explain oin one slide the delayed gratification experiment.
